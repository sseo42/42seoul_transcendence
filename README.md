* what is Ruby on Rails?

    Rails is a server-side Web application framework written in Ruby.
    It's characterized by fllowing 3 things.
    
    * MVC(model-view-controller)
      
      MVC is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces.
      It separates an application into 3 parts aiming to make it easier to control / maintain.
      * Model component is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface,
      it directly mamage the data and logics of the application.
      * View componet shows any representation of data, multiple views of the same information are possible.
      It doesn't change the data.
      * Controller component accepts inputs from the user and convert it to commands for the Model or View.
      
    * CoC(Convention over configuration)
      
      Coc is a design paradigm aimed to decrease the number of decisions that a developer required to make without losing flexibility.
      Coc means that setting conventional configurations to default so that developer only needs to sepecify unconventional aspects of the application.
      This might conflict with other software design principles(like Zen of Python)
      
    * DRY(Don't repeat yourself)


      DRY is a principle of software developement aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, 
      replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
      The DRY priciple is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representaion within a system.
